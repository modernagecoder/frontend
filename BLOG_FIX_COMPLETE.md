---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. CSS Loading Issue ✅
- **Before**: CSS wasn't being copied to blog directories
- **After**: `style.css` is now properly copied from `src/css/style.css` to each blog post directory
- **Result**: All blog pages now display with proper styling

### 2. JavaScript Not Working ✅
- **Before**: Script was looking for `blog-navigation.js` in wrong location (project root)
- **After**: Fixed path to `src/js/blog-navigation.js` and added `src/js/navigation.js`
- **Result**: Both navigation scripts now load and function correctly

### 3. Navigation Links Broken ✅
- **Before**: Templates had incorrect paths like `../../index10.html` and `../../course8.html`
- **After**: Updated all navigation links to use proper absolute paths
- **Result**: All navigation links work correctly from any page

### 4. Main Site Blog Link ✅
- **Before**: Blog link pointed to `/blog` (non-existent)
- **After**: Updated to `/content/blog/generated/index.html` across all pages
- **Result**: Blog is accessible from main navigation on all pages
