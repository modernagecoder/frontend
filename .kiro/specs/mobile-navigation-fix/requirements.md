# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical mobile navigation usability issues on the Modern Age Coders website. Users are experiencing two main problems: (1) the hamburger menu button is not clickable on mobile devices due to z-index layering issues, and (2) tab buttons for age groups (Kids/Teens) and subject categories (Maths/Coding) are squeezed and difficult to interact with on mobile screens. These issues significantly impact mobile user experience and need to be resolved to ensure proper navigation functionality across all devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Mobile Hamburger Menu Clickability

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to be able to tap the hamburger menu button, so that I can access the navigation menu and browse the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the website on a mobile device (max-width: 768px) THEN the hamburger menu button SHALL be visible and positioned above all other page elements
2. WHEN a user taps the hamburger menu button THEN the system SHALL respond immediately and toggle the mobile navigation menu
3. WHEN the mobile menu is open THEN the system SHALL display the navigation links with proper spacing and readability
4. WHEN the hamburger menu button is displayed THEN it SHALL have a z-index value higher than the navbar and other page content to ensure clickability
5. IF the navbar or other elements are overlapping the hamburger button THEN the system SHALL adjust z-index values to ensure the button remains interactive

### Requirement 2: Improve Mobile Tab Button Layout and Usability

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to easily see and select tab options for age groups and subject categories, so that I can navigate to the content I'm interested in without difficulty.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views tab buttons (Kids/Teens/College/Girls) on mobile THEN the system SHALL display them with adequate spacing and touch-friendly sizing (minimum 44x44px touch target)
2. WHEN tab buttons are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL be horizontally scrollable if they don't fit on screen, with clear visual indicators
3. WHEN a user views the Maths and Coding section tabs on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure buttons are not squeezed or overlapping
4. WHEN tab buttons are rendered THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate padding, font-size, and min-width values for mobile devices
5. IF tab buttons appear cramped THEN the system SHALL adjust the layout to use a scrollable horizontal container or stack them vertically
6. WHEN a user scrolls through horizontal tabs THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling with scroll-snap behavior for better UX

### Requirement 3: Ensure Consistent Mobile Navigation Experience

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a consistent and intuitive navigation experience across all pages, so that I can easily find and access content throughout the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation elements are displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent z-index hierarchy across all pages
2. WHEN the user interacts with navigation elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (hover/active states adapted for touch)
3. WHEN the mobile menu is open THEN the system SHALL prevent body scrolling to avoid confusion
4. WHEN navigation elements overlap THEN the system SHALL ensure proper layering with header > mobile menu > page content
5. IF the user has the mobile menu open and taps outside THEN the system SHALL close the menu automatically

### Requirement 4: Optimize Touch Targets for Mobile Accessibility

**User Story:** As a mobile user with varying finger sizes and dexterity, I want all interactive elements to be easily tappable, so that I can navigate the website without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactive elements (buttons, links, tabs) are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL meet the minimum touch target size of 44x44 pixels
2. WHEN multiple interactive elements are adjacent THEN the system SHALL provide adequate spacing (minimum 8px) between them
3. WHEN tab buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL have sufficient padding to create comfortable touch targets
4. WHEN the hamburger menu button is displayed THEN it SHALL be at least 44x44 pixels in size
5. IF touch targets are smaller than recommended THEN the system SHALL increase padding or dimensions to meet accessibility standards
