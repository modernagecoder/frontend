6. /courses/artificial-intelligence-complete-masterclass-college

Last Crawled: Nov 10, 2025

Probable Reasons

Very similar to AI/ML page

Competing with your own page (keyword cannibalization)

Google unsure which page to rank

Duplicate intent

Required Fix (Very Important)

Decide:

Merge with AI/ML page OR

Clearly differentiate (AI theory vs applied ML)

If kept separate:

Rewrite completely

Add canonical

Strengthen internal hierarchy (parent → child pages)

Global Technical Checks (Must Be Done for ALL Pages)

Ask dev team to confirm:

No noindex meta tag

No X-Robots-Tag: noindex

HTTP status = 200 OK

robots.txt allows /courses/

Canonical is correct

Mobile usability is good

Page speed acceptable
