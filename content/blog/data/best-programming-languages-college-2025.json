Learn JavaScript second if you're interested in web development. If you're certain you want to do web development exclusively, starting with JavaScript is also valid.

Employers prefer candidates who know one language well over those who know five languages superficially. Focus on mastering one language before adding another."

However, Python and JavaScript developers at top companies can earn ₹40-100+ LPA. The language matters less than your skill level and the company you work for. A senior Python developer at Google earns more than a junior Rust developer at a startup."

This includes learning a language deeply, building projects, and preparing for interviews. Students who practice sporadically take 2-3x longer. The key is consistency—code every single day, even if just for 30 minutes."

Start with Python basics, then move to data science libraries, then ML frameworks. It's a longer learning path (12-18 months) but offers the highest salary potential (₹15-100+ LPA).
