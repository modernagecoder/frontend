          },
          {
            "title": "What if I can't finish in 60 days?",
            "content": "That's okay! The timeline is a guide, not a strict deadline. Life happens—exams, family, other commitments. The goal is consistent progress. If it takes 90 days, you still end up with a published app."

          {
            "title": "What if my app gets rejected by the store?",
            "content": "It happens! Apple especially has strict guidelines. Read the rejection reason carefully, fix the issue, and resubmit. Most rejections are for fixable problems like missing privacy policy, unclear permissions, or minor guideline violations."

            "title": "Should I monetize my first app?",
            "content": "Keep it simple—free app, maybe with optional ads (AdMob is easy to integrate). Your first app's goal is learning and portfolio-building, not profit. Monetization is easier once you understand what users want."

App Store Optimization (ASO) helps with discoverability—good keywords, screenshots, and descriptions."

          {
            "title": "Is this worth it if my app only gets a few downloads?",
            "content": "Absolutely. Download counts matter less than what you learned and what you can show. A published app on your portfolio demonstrates real skills. The experience alone is worth more than any download number."
