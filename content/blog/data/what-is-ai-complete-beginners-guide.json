Jobs requiring creativity, emotional intelligence, complex problem-solving, and human judgment are safe. People who understand and work with AI will be in high demand.

            "content": "Absolutely not! Many successful AI practitioners started in their 30s, 40s, or even 50s. Your life experience, domain knowledge, and problem-solving skills are valuable assets. You might learn differently than 20-year-olds, but you bring maturity, focus, and real-world perspective. Age is not a barrier—motivation and consistency are what matter. Many companies value diverse age ranges for different perspectives. Start today, regardless of age. The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago; the second best time is now."
