If interactions are rare or simple, a good mobile website might be enough. Ask yourself: Would my customers use this weekly? Can I offer something valuable that a website can't? Do I have the resources to maintain it? If yes to all three, an app is worth considering."

Ongoing costs include hosting (₹2,000-20,000/month), maintenance (15-20% of development cost annually), and updates. Start by defining what you need, then get quotes.

Offer a signup bonus (10-20% discount or bonus points). Make the first experience great so users keep it installed. Track your download sources to see what's working.

Cross-platform development tools (React Native, Flutter) let you build for both from one codebase, reducing cost by 30-40%.

Quality and relevance matter more than frequency. Transactional notifications (order updates, appointment reminders) can be frequent. Promotional notifications should be limited. Segment your audience—power users can handle more notifications than casual users. Apps that send more than 5 promotional notifications per week see 20% higher uninstall rates."

Apps offer: offline functionality, push notifications, device feature access (camera, GPS), faster performance, home screen presence, and better user experience.

For most businesses, you need both—a mobile-optimized website for discovery and an app for engaged customers."

This includes planning, design, development, testing, and launch. Using app builders or templates can reduce this to weeks. Factor in additional time for app store approval (1-2 weeks for iOS, 1-3 days for Android) and initial bug fixes post-launch.
