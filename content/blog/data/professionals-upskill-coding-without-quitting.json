Front-load your week so busy Fridays don't derail you. Accept that some weeks will be lighter, and that's okay. Consistency over months matters more than perfection in any single week."

However, certain certifications (AWS, Google Cloud, specific vendor certs) can help for specialized roles. A CS degree isn't required but can help for certain companies.
