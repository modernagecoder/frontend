They should show increasing persistence, ask specific questions (not just \"it doesn't work\"), and retain concepts week-to-week. Red flags include only copying without understanding, random trial-and-error with no logic, or showing no problem-solving attempts before giving up."

It offers the right complexity level—visual blocks bridge to text-based coding, teaches real programming concepts, and provides years of growth potential. The massive community offers inspiration, and projects are shareable. It balances creative freedom with structured learning, making it ideal for developing both logical thinking and creative problem-solving at this critical age."

Their reading fluency, abstract thinking ability, and attention span make them ready for structured programming fundamentals. Start with beginner-friendly platforms like Scratch or Code.org's 2nd-grade courses. Expect 4-6 weeks for initial comfort with concepts, then steady progress. No need to have started younger—7-year-olds can build strong foundations from scratch and often catch up to earlier starters within 3-6 months."
