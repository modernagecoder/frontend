Bill Gates wrote his first program at 13, a tic-tac-toe game. Elon Musk taught himself coding at 10 and sold his first game, Blastar, at 12 for $500.

He built a tutoring platform that connected 500+ students with tutors, earning ₹50,000 in revenue. At 17, he secured a summer internship at a Bangalore startup (₹30,000/month). When he entered college at 18, he already had entrepreneurial experience, professional work experience, and a strong portfolio—advantages that led to a ₹18 lakh placement offer in his sophomore year."
