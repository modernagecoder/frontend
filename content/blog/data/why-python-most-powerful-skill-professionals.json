            "content": "Structured courses with practical projects work best. Combine learning with immediate application to your work. Consistency (even 30 minutes daily) beats sporadic intensive sessions. Look for courses designed for professionals, not computer science students—they focus on practical applications rather than theory."

Your domain expertise (finance, marketing, operations, etc.) is actually more valuable than CS knowledge for most professional applications."

Excel is fine for simple tasks, but Python scales better for serious analysis. Many professionals use both—Excel for quick ad-hoc work, Python for complex or repeated analyses."

Learning Python first gives you flexibility—you can then apply it to analytics, automation, or other areas based on your interests and needs. Many data analytics courses teach Python anyway, so learning Python directly is often more efficient."

Most professionals find that even 30 minutes of focused practice on a laptop is more effective than hours of mobile learning."
