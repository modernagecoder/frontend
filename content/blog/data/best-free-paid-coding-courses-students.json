          {
            "title": "Are free coding courses enough to get a job?",
            "content": "Yes, but with caveats. Free courses can teach you skills, but you'll need to supplement with projects, portfolio building, and possibly certifications. Many successful developers are self-taught using free resources, but it requires more self-discipline and initiative. Statistics show self-taught developers using only free resources take 18-24 months to become job-ready, compared to 9-12 months with structured paid programs."
          },
          {
            "title": "How much should I spend on coding courses?",
            "content": "There's no fixed amount—it depends on your goals and timeline. Start with free resources to confirm your interest. If you're serious about a tech career, investing ₹10,000-25,000 in quality courses can accelerate your learning significantly. Think of it as an investment: even ₹20,000 spent on the right course can lead to a ₹5-10 LPA job within a year—that's 25-50x return."
          },
          {
            "title": "Which programming language should I learn first?",
            "content": "Python is the most beginner-friendly and versatile choice. It's used in web development, data science, AI, automation, and more. JavaScript is another great option if you're specifically interested in web development. Avoid starting with C++ or Java unless your college curriculum requires it—they have steeper learning curves."
          },
          {
            "title": "How long does it take to learn coding?",
            "content": "Basic proficiency: 3-6 months of consistent practice (1-2 hours daily). Job-ready skills: 6-12 months with structured learning. Mastery: 2-3 years of professional experience. The key is consistent daily practice—30 minutes every day beats 5 hours on weekends."

          {
            "title": "Do certificates from online courses matter to employers?",
            "content": "Certificates help but projects matter more. Employers want to see what you can build. A strong portfolio with 3-4 real projects often outweighs certificates from prestigious platforms. That said, certificates from Google, IBM, or universities (via Coursera) do carry weight and can help you pass initial resume screening."
          },
          {
            "title": "Should I learn from multiple platforms simultaneously?",
            "content": "No—this is a common mistake. Focus on one primary learning resource at a time. Jumping between platforms creates gaps in knowledge and slows progress. Complete one course fully before starting another. You can use supplementary resources (like documentation or YouTube) for specific topics, but your main curriculum should be singular."
          },
          {
            "title": "Is Coursera financial aid really free?",
            "content": "Yes! Coursera's financial aid covers 100% of course fees, including certificates. You need to write a short application (150-200 words) explaining why you need aid. Most applications are approved within 15 days. It's available for individual courses and specializations. Highly recommended for students."

          {
            "title": "What's the best course for someone with zero coding experience?",
            "content": "Start with Codecademy's free tier or Khan Academy to get comfortable with basic concepts. Then move to freeCodeCamp for web development or a structured course like Modern Age Coders for Python. The key is starting with something interactive and beginner-friendly before diving into comprehensive programs."

          {
            "title": "Are bootcamps worth the high cost?",
            "content": "Bootcamps like Scaler (₹2.5-3.5 lakhs) can be worth it for the right person—typically working professionals or final-year students who need intensive, placement-focused training. However, for college students with time, more affordable options can achieve similar results with more effort. Calculate the ROI: if a bootcamp helps you land a job 6 months faster at ₹15 LPA vs ₹8 LPA, the investment pays off."

          {
            "title": "How do I know if a course is outdated?",
            "content": "Check: 1) When was it last updated? (Should be within 12-18 months), 2) What version of technologies does it teach? (e.g., React 18 vs React 16), 3) Read recent reviews—students will mention if content is outdated, 4) Check if the instructor is active and responding to questions. Avoid courses that haven't been updated in 2+ years."
