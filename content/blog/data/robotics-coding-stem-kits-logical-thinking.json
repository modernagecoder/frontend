            "title": "Are robotics kits worth the high cost?",
            "content": "Quality robotics kits provide hundreds of hours of learning and are often expandable. Consider cost-per-hour of engagement. Start with mid-range options (mBot, Sphero) and upgrade if interest persists. Many families find the investment worthwhile."
