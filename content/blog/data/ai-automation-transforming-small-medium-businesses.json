The interfaces are point-and-click, with tutorials and support.

For example, use AI to draft content that humans review, not to make final decisions on loans or medical diagnoses. Always keep humans in the loop for important decisions. As you build trust in the system's accuracy, you can gradually increase automation. Most businesses find AI makes fewer mistakes than humans on repetitive tasks once properly configured."

            "content": "Yes, but it's usually not necessary or cost-effective for SMBs. Custom AI development costs ₹20-80 lakhs and takes 6-18 months. Off-the-shelf tools cost ₹5,000-50,000/month and work immediately. Build custom only if: (1) Your needs are truly unique, (2) AI is your competitive advantage, (3) You have the budget and timeline. For most businesses, combining existing tools creatively solves 90% of needs at 10% of the cost.
