            "title": "Do I need a degree in computer science or mathematics to learn data science?",
            "content": "No. While a technical degree can help, it's not required. Many successful data scientists come from diverse backgrounds—biology, economics, psychology, business. What matters is your willingness to learn the fundamentals and apply them. The skills can be learned through online courses, bootcamps, and self-study. Your domain expertise from other fields can actually be an advantage."
          },
          {
            "title": "How long does it take to become job-ready in data science?",
            "content": "It depends on your starting point and goals. Complete beginners typically need 12-18 months of consistent learning (10+ hours/week) to become job-ready for entry-level data analyst or junior data scientist roles. Programmers transitioning can often do it in 6-9 months. Analysts adding ML skills might need 4-6 months. These timelines assume consistent effort and project-based learning."
          },
          {
            "title": "Should I learn Python or R for data science?",
            "content": "Start with Python. It's more versatile (web development, automation, ML, deep learning), has better job market demand, and is easier to learn. R is excellent for statistical analysis and is popular in academia and some industries (pharma, biotech), but Python is the safer bet for most career paths. You can always add R later if your specific role requires it."
          },
          {
            "title": "Is it too late to start learning data science at 35/40/45?",
            "content": "Absolutely not. Your professional experience is an asset, not a liability. Domain expertise combined with data science skills is highly valuable. Many successful career changers are in their 30s and 40s. Companies increasingly value professionals who understand business problems, not just algorithms. Your maturity, work ethic, and domain knowledge can outweigh a younger candidate's technical head start."
          },
          {
            "title": "How important is mathematics for data science?",
            "content": "Important, but not as scary as people think. You need working knowledge of linear algebra, calculus, and statistics—not PhD-level expertise. Focus on intuition over computation. Understanding why gradient descent works matters more than deriving it from scratch. Most professionals can build sufficient math foundations in 2-3 months of focused study. Don't let math anxiety stop you from starting."
          },
          {
            "title": "Can I learn data science while working full-time?",
            "content": "Yes, thousands of professionals do it every year. The key is consistency over intensity. 5-10 hours per week of focused learning can produce meaningful progress over 12-18 months. Use commute time, lunch breaks, early mornings, or evenings. The slower pace actually helps retention because you have time to process and apply what you learn."
          },
          {
            "title": "What's the difference between data analyst, data scientist, and ML engineer?",
            "content": "Data Analysts focus on descriptive analytics—understanding what happened through SQL, Excel, and visualization. Data Scientists build predictive models and work on more complex statistical analysis. ML Engineers focus on deploying and scaling ML models in production systems. There's overlap, and career paths often progress from analyst to scientist to engineer. Start where your skills fit and grow from there."
          },
          {
            "title": "Are bootcamps worth the investment?",
            "content": "It depends. Good bootcamps provide structure, accountability, and career support that self-study lacks. They can accelerate learning significantly. However, they're expensive ($10,000-$20,000+) and quality varies widely. Research outcomes data, talk to alumni, and consider whether you have the discipline for self-study. For many working professionals, structured online courses offer a better balance of cost, flexibility, and quality."

          {
            "title": "How do I build a portfolio without work experience?",
            "content": "Use public datasets from Kaggle, UCI Repository, or government open data. Solve real problems—analyze COVID data, predict housing prices, build a recommendation system. Contribute to open source projects. Participate in Kaggle competitions. Document everything on GitHub with clear READMEs. Quality matters more than quantity—3 well-documented projects beat 10 half-finished ones."

            "title": "What salary can I expect as a data scientist in India?",
            "content": "Entry-level data analysts typically earn ₹4-8 LPA. Junior data scientists start at ₹8-15 LPA. Mid-level professionals (3-5 years) earn ₹15-25 LPA. Senior data scientists and ML engineers can earn ₹25-50+ LPA. Salaries vary significantly by city (Bangalore pays highest), company type (startups vs. MNCs), and specialization (ML engineers typically earn more than analysts). Domain expertise can add 20-30% premium."
