            "content": "Both are excellent. Python is better for general programming, data science, AI, and automation. JavaScript is essential for web development and provides immediate visual feedback. Choose based on your child's interests—or learn both over time. Most professional developers know both."

            "content": "These are more challenging and better suited for older teens (15+) who have programming experience. They're valuable for specific goals (game engines, Android apps, AP CS, competitive programming) but not ideal first languages. Starting with these often leads to frustration."

            "content": "Roblox uses Lua, which is a good intermediate language. However, if they're complete beginners, starting with Scratch first (even briefly) helps build programming concepts that make Lua easier to learn. If they're 12+ and motivated, they can start directly with Lua in Roblox Studio."

            "content": "Not at all! Scratch is used by MIT students and professional educators. The 'childish' appearance is intentional—it removes barriers to learning. Many 12-year-olds benefit from Scratch, especially if they're new to coding. That said, if your child feels it's too easy or is resistant, Python is a great alternative."

            "content": "For Scratch: 6-12 months or until they're creating complex projects easily. For Python/JavaScript: 12-18 months to build solid fundamentals. The goal isn't to 'finish' a language but to reach comfortable proficiency where they can build projects independently."

          {
            "title": "What if my child loses interest in the language we chose?",
            "content": "First, try connecting the language to their interests (games, art, music). If that doesn't work, it's okay to switch! The concepts they learned transfer. Sometimes a different language or project type reignites enthusiasm. The goal is long-term coding literacy, not commitment to one specific language."

            "content": "Yes, if they're interested in web development. HTML/CSS aren't programming languages—they're markup and styling—but they're essential for web development and provide quick visual results. A few weeks of HTML/CSS before JavaScript gives context for what JavaScript does."
