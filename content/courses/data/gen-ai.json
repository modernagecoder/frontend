  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why should I learn Generative AI now? Isn't it too competitive?",
      "answer": "Generative AI is the fastest-growing field in tech with massive shortage of skilled professionals. Every company from startups to Fortune 500 is racing to adopt AI. There are 10-20 AI job openings for every qualified candidate. Early movers (now) will have 5-10 year career advantage. Salaries range from ₹10-80 LPA in India and $120k-300k globally. It's not too late - it's the perfect time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this Generative AI course suitable for complete beginners with no coding experience?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We start from absolute zero - teaching Python from scratch, mathematics needed for AI, ML fundamentals, then gradually moving to LLMs, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and building production AI systems. Our structured 12-month curriculum takes you from 'What is AI?' to building enterprise-grade AI applications. Thousands of non-technical people have successfully transitioned to AI careers through this program."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes this different from other AI courses and ChatGPT tutorials?",
      "answer": "Unlike superficial ChatGPT tutorials, we teach deep fundamentals: transformer architecture, how LLMs actually work, training models from scratch, fine-tuning, RAG systems, AI agents, production deployment, and MLOps. You'll build 50+ real projects, not just use APIs. We cover OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), open-source models (Llama, Mistral), LangChain, vector databases, and the entire modern AI stack. This is professional AI engineering, not just prompt writing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of projects will I build and can I use them for my portfolio?",
      "answer": "You'll build 50+ projects including: ChatGPT clones, RAG-powered Q&A systems, AI agents for automation, fine-tuned models for specific domains, image generation apps, multi-agent systems, production AI APIs, and a final masterpiece project. All projects are production-ready and portfolio-worthy. You'll deploy them to cloud, create demos, and showcase them on GitHub. These projects alone can land you AI jobs at top companies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I learn to train and fine-tune my own AI models or just use APIs?",
      "answer": "Both! You'll master using APIs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) for rapid development AND learn to train transformers from scratch, fine-tune Llama/Mistral models, implement LoRA/QLoRA, use RLHF and DPO for alignment, optimize models for production, and deploy them at scale. We cover the full spectrum from using commercial APIs to training custom models on your data."
    },
    {
      "question": "What salary can I expect after completing this Generative AI masterclass?",
      "answer": "Salaries vary by experience level: After 6 months ₹8-15 LPA as AI developer, after 12 months ₹15-30 LPA as AI Engineer, with 2-3 years ₹30-70 LPA as Senior/Lead. AI startups offer ₹25-80 LPA + equity. FAANG companies pay ₹40-100 LPA. International remote jobs offer $120k-300k USD. Freelance AI consulting can earn ₹2000-10000/hour. The AI talent shortage means exceptional compensation for skilled professionals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need an expensive GPU to learn Generative AI?",
      "answer": "No! While a NVIDIA GPU helps, it's not required. We'll teach you to use Google Colab (free GPU), Kaggle notebooks (free GPU), and cloud platforms. For production work, we cover AWS SageMaker, Azure, and GCP. We also teach optimization techniques to run models on consumer hardware. Many students complete the entire course using only free resources and land high-paying jobs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is this different from a traditional ML/Data Science course?",
      "answer": "Traditional ML courses focus on classical ML algorithms (linear regression, random forests, etc.) while we focus on modern Generative AI: Large Language Models (GPT, Claude, Llama), transformer architecture, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, RAG systems, AI agents, diffusion models for images, and multimodal AI. These are the technologies companies are desperately hiring for in 2024-2025. You'll learn some foundational ML, but 80% focus is on cutting-edge GenAI."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this course help me get a job at AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google DeepMind?",
      "answer": "Yes! Our curriculum is based on job requirements at top AI companies. We cover: transformer architecture, training large models, RLHF, prompt engineering, production deployment, system design for AI, research paper implementation, and building novel applications. We provide interview preparation, system design practice, and coding challenges. Many graduates have joined leading AI companies, well-funded startups, and research labs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I build my own AI startup or product after this course?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! You'll learn everything needed to build AI products: ideation, architecture design, MVP development, model selection/fine-tuning, RAG implementation, agent systems, production deployment, monitoring, and scaling. We cover business strategy, monetization, and go-to-market for AI products. Many students have launched successful AI startups, consulting practices, or SaaS products generating significant revenue."

      "We're witnessing the biggest technological revolution since the internet. Generative AI is not just a trend - it's fundamentally changing how we work, create, and solve problems. ChatGPT reached 100 million users in 2 months. Every Fortune 500 company is racing to adopt AI. Startups are raising billions. Governments are investing trillions. This is the defining technology of our generation.",
      "The AI talent shortage is unprecedented. Companies are desperate for AI engineers who understand LLMs, can build production systems, fine-tune models, implement RAG, and create AI agents. Salaries have skyrocketed: ₹15-40 LPA in India, $150k-300k in the US, with top talent commanding even more. This isn't hype - it's supply and demand fundamentals.",
      "But here's the opportunity: most 'AI experts' only know surface-level ChatGPT usage. Our masterclass teaches you real AI engineering - from transformer architecture to training models, from prompt engineering to production deployment. You'll build a portfolio of 50+ projects that showcases genuine expertise. After 12 months, you'll be in the top 1% of AI practitioners globally, positioned to shape the future and build a extraordinary career.",
      "The next decade belongs to AI engineers. Foundation model companies need talent. Every industry needs AI transformation. Startups need technical co-founders. The opportunities are limitless. The question isn't 'Should I learn AI?' - it's 'Can I afford NOT to?' This is your chance to be at the forefront of the AI revolution."
