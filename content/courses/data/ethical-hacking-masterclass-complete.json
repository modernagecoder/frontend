  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What is ethical hacking and is it a legal career path?",
      "answer": "Ethical hacking (also called penetration testing or white-hat hacking) involves legally and systematically testing computer systems, networks, and applications for security vulnerabilities - with permission. It's completely legal and highly respected. Companies pay ethical hackers ₹6-70+ LPA to find vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do. Certifications like CEH, OSCP, and formal authorization make this a legitimate, in-demand profession."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need prior programming or IT experience for this ethical hacking course?",
      "answer": "No prior experience required! We start from absolute basics: Linux fundamentals, networking concepts, and then Python scripting. Whether you're a complete beginner or IT professional, this 26-week intensive program builds your skills systematically. Many successful ethical hackers and bug bounty hunters started with zero technical background."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tools and techniques will I learn in this cybersecurity masterclass?",
      "answer": "You'll master 50+ tools including Kali Linux, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark, Nessus, John the Ripper, and custom Python scripts. Techniques cover web application hacking, network attacks, wireless hacking, social engineering, malware analysis, cloud security (AWS/Azure/GCP), and mobile app security."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I earn money through bug bounties while learning this course?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We dedicate a full module to bug bounty hunting on platforms like HackerOne, Bugcrowd, and Synack. Many students earn their first bounties while still studying. Individual bug bounties range from ₹2,000 to ₹15+ Lakhs depending on severity. Some skilled hunters earn ₹50+ Lakhs annually through bug bounties alone."
    },
    {
      "question": "What certifications does this course prepare me for?",
      "answer": "This course prepares you for major industry certifications: CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker), OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional), CompTIA Security+, CompTIA PenTest+, GPEN, and cloud security certifications. We provide dedicated certification prep modules with practice exams and study strategies."
    },
    {
      "question": "What salary can I expect as an ethical hacker in India and globally?",
      "answer": "Cybersecurity salaries are exceptionally high due to talent shortage. Entry-level: ₹3-6 LPA, Mid-level: ₹10-20 LPA, Senior: ₹25-45 LPA, FAANG companies: ₹35-70 LPA (India) or $130k-280k (USA). Freelance consultants charge ₹2,500-12,000/hour. Security architects earn ₹40-90 LPA at senior levels. The demand far exceeds supply globally."
