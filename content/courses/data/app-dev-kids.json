      "Building apps used to require years of learning complex programming languages. Not anymore. Block coding platforms like MIT App Inventor and Thunkable let kids create real, working mobile apps using visual drag-and-drop blocks—no typing code required. This revolutionary approach makes app development accessible to anyone.",
      "Our program takes kids from absolute zero to publishing apps on Google Play and App Store. They'll build 70+ apps across gaming, education, social media, and AI categories. Every project is designed to be fun while teaching real programming concepts that transfer to any language they learn later.",
      "Beyond technical skills, kids develop creativity, problem-solving, and entrepreneurial thinking. Many of our students have published apps downloaded by thousands of users, won app competitions, and even earned money from their creations. Some go on to learn traditional programming, now equipped with a deep understanding of how apps work."
