# Login and Mobile Navigation Update

## Summary of Changes

This update addresses two key user experience issues:

### 1. Courses Dropdown Hidden on Mobile
**Problem**: The courses dropdown menu was visible on mobile devices, causing navigation issues for mobile users.

**Solution**: 
- Added CSS media query to hide the courses dropdown on screens smaller than 768px (mobile devices)
- The dropdown remains visible and functional on tablets and desktops
- Mobile users can still access courses through the "Start Learning" CTA button

**Files Modified**:
- `src/css/responsive.css` - Added media query to hide courses dropdown on mobile

```css
/* Hide courses dropdown on mobile - only show on tablet/desktop */
@media (max-width: 767px) {
  .nav-item.dropdown:has(.nav-link[href*="course"]) {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

### 2. Dedicated Login Page with Tabs
**Problem**: Login was handled through a dropdown menu with modal popups, which wasn't ideal for mobile users.

**Solution**:
- Created a dedicated login page (`src/pages/login.html`) with a clean, modern design
- Implemented tab-based interface with two tabs: "Student" and "Teacher"
- Each tab has its own login form with proper validation
- Mobile-optimized with touch-friendly buttons (minimum 44x44px)
- Smooth animations and visual feedback
- Password visibility toggle
- Proper error handling and success messages
- Redirects to appropriate dashboard after successful login

**Files Created**:
- `src/pages/login.html` - Dedicated login page with tabbed interface
- `src/js/login-page.js` - JavaScript for tab switching and form handling

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/index.html` - Changed login dropdown to direct link to login page
- `src/js/auth.js` - Updated UI functions to work with new login approach
- `src/js/navigation.js` - Updated dropdown handler to allow normal navigation for login link

- **Auto-redirect**: Automatically redirects to appropriate dashboard
- **Session Check**: Redirects already logged-in users

### Accessibility

## User Flow

### Before (Old Approach)
1. User clicks "Login" in navigation
2. Dropdown appears with "Student Login" and "Teacher Login"
3. Modal popup opens
4. User enters credentials
5. Modal closes on success

### After (New Approach)
1. User clicks "Login" in navigation
2. Redirected to dedicated login page
3. User selects Student or Teacher tab
4. User enters credentials in clean form
5. Redirected to dashboard on success

## Mobile Navigation Improvements

### Courses Dropdown
- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Hidden completely
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: Visible with hover/click functionality
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: Visible with hover functionality

### Login Access
- **Mobile**: Direct link to login page (no dropdown)
- **Tablet/Desktop**: Can use dropdown when logged in (shows user menu)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Mobile Testing**:
   - Verify courses dropdown is hidden on phones
   - Test login page on various mobile screen sizes
   - Verify touch targets are easily tappable
   - Test form submission on mobile

2. **Tablet Testing**:
   - Verify courses dropdown is visible
   - Test login page layout
   - Verify navigation works properly

3. **Desktop Testing**:
   - Verify all dropdowns work with hover
   - Test login page on large screens
   - Verify logged-in user menu appears correctly

4. **Cross-Browser Testing**:
   - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
   - Verify CSS compatibility
   - Test JavaScript functionality

5. **Authentication Testing**:
   - Test successful login (student and teacher)
   - Test failed login with wrong credentials
   - Test session persistence
   - Test logout functionality
   - Test redirect behavior

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Notes

- The old modal-based login system is still present in `auth.js` for backward compatibility
- The login page uses the same API endpoints as the modal system

- The courses dropdown can be re-enabled on mobile by removing the CSS media query if needed
