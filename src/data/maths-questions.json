        "explanation": "If a number is divisible by two coprime numbers (numbers that share no factors other than 1), it is divisible by their product. Since 3 and 5 are prime (and thus coprime), any number divisible by both must be divisible by 3 × 5 = 15.",

        "explanation": "To move from top-left (0,0) to bottom-right (4,4) in a 4x4 grid (assuming 4 unit steps down and 4 unit steps right, total grid size usually implies cells, but standard grid path problems on n x n lattice points imply n steps R and n steps D). Let's assume a grid of 4x4 squares, meaning 4 steps Right and 4 steps Down needed. Total steps = 8. You must choose which 4 of these 8 steps are 'Right'. The formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n=8 and k=4. 8! / (4! * 4!) = (8*7*6*5) / (4*3*2*1) = 1680 / 24 = 70.",
