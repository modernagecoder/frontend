# CSS Fix Summary

## Problem
The generated course pages in `content/courses/generated/` were missing proper CSS styling because the CSS files were not being correctly copied from the source.

## Root Cause
In `scripts/generate-courses.js`, the CSS source path was incorrectly set to:
```javascript
const cssSourcePath = path.join(this.generatedDir, 'style.css');
```

This was pointing to the DESTINATION directory instead of the SOURCE directory (`src/css/style.css`).

## Solution
Fixed the CSS copying logic in `scripts/generate-courses.js`:

1. **Changed the CSS source path** to correctly point to the source file:
```javascript
const cssSourcePath = path.join(this.projectRoot, 'src', 'css', 'style.css');
const cssDestPath = path.join(this.generatedDir, 'style.css');
```

2. **Added proper file copying** from source to generated directory:
```javascript
if (fs.existsSync(cssSourcePath)) {
    fs.copyFileSync(cssSourcePath, cssDestPath);
    console.log('✓ Copied main CSS file to generated directory');
}
```

3. **Updated individual course CSS copying** to use the correct destination path:
```javascript
if (fs.existsSync(cssDestPath)) {
    fs.copyFileSync(cssDestPath, courseCssPath);
}
```

## Verification
After running `node scripts/generate-courses.js`:
- ✅ All 27 course directories now have the complete CSS file
- ✅ All CSS files are identical to the source (247,982 bytes)
- ✅ CSS files are properly copied from `src/css/style.css` to:
  - `content/courses/generated/style.css` (main copy)
  - `content/courses/generated/[course-slug]/style.css` (individual course copies)

## Files Modified
- `scripts/generate-courses.js` - Fixed CSS copying logic

## Result
All generated course pages now have complete and proper CSS styling. No CSS is missing.
