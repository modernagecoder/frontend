# Mobile Navigation & Tabs Fix - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hamburger Menu Not Working
**Problem:** The mobile hamburger menu button was not visible or clickable on phones.

**Solution:**
- Made the hamburger button display properly with `display: flex !important` at 900px breakpoint
- Increased button size to 32x24px for better touch targets
- Fixed z-index to ensure button stays on top (z-index: 9999)
- Added proper spacing between the three bars

### 2. Navigation Menu Not Showing
**Problem:** When clicking the hamburger, the navigation menu wasn't appearing.

**Solution:**
- Changed menu position from `absolute` to `fixed` for full-screen overlay
- Set proper height: `calc(100vh - 70px)` to fill the screen below header
- Added dark overlay background: `rgba(10, 10, 20, 0.98)`
- Improved backdrop blur for better visibility
- Added body scroll lock when menu is open

### 3. Dropdown Navigation Not Working on Mobile
**Problem:** Dropdown menus (Courses, Login) weren't expanding on mobile.

**Solution:**
- Added click event handlers for dropdowns on mobile
- Changed dropdown display from hover-based to click-based on mobile
- Added visual feedback with background colors
- Ensured dropdowns close when clicking on items
- Added proper spacing and padding for touch targets

### 4. Tabs (Kids, Teens, etc.) Squeezed Up
**Problem:** The course tabs were cramped and hard to read/tap on mobile.

**Solution:**
- Made tabs horizontally scrollable with smooth scrolling
- Increased minimum width to 150px (130px on very small phones)
- Added proper padding: 1rem 1.5rem for comfortable touch targets
- Added scroll snap for better UX
- Made active tab more visible with background color and border
- Added visible scrollbar with custom styling
- Removed the glider animation on mobile (not needed with new styling)

### 5. Math Tabs Styling
**Problem:** Math section tabs needed consistent mobile styling.

**Solution:**
- Applied orange/gold color scheme to math tabs on mobile
- Ensured active state is clearly visible
- Maintained consistency with coding tabs styling
